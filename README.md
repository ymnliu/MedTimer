# Introduction

MedTime is an Apache UIMA based temporal information extraction system developed by the Mayo Clinic NLP program. It extracts and normalizes TIMEX3-based temporal expressions
from clinical text. MedTime has been adapted from the
open-source temporal tagger, HeidelTime (https://github.com/HeidelTime/heideltime)
but re-engineered toward the clinical domain.

## What's new

Updated temporal expression extraction module for general purpose clinical texts,
which does not require section times or specific text metadata.

## Installation
Java requirement: Java 1.7.

If you are using UNIX, simply:

```
./runCPE.sh
```

In the menu of the CPE window, go to `"File"` -> `"Open CPE Descriptor"` and select `./desc/medtimedesc/collection_process_engine/MedTimeCPE.xml`.
You may change the `"Input Directory"` and `"Output Dir"` as needed. We suggest to use the default `FileCollectionReader` and `MedTimeWriter`.


## For developers
###  Sub directories included in MedTimer
 
* javasrc - source folder includes java source codes distributed
* autosrc - source folder automatically generated by JCas_gen for the centralized type system 
* descsrc - contains types and primitive analysis engines, collection readers, and cas consumers (not recommended to modify if you have limited knowledge with respect to UIMA)
* desc - example descriptors for aggregate analysis engines and collection processing engines
* medtaggerdescsrc -- source folders contains types and primitive analysis engines, collection readers, and cas consumers in MedTagger
* lib - a collection of libraries that MedTagger is based on
* resources - resources required to run MedTime (including those for running MedTagger)
* testdata - shipped test data to run all annotators
 

### MedTimer UIMA descriptors

* Primary Annotators
`MedTimeAE.xml`: finds temporal expressions and normalizes them according to the TIMEX3 TimeML annotation standard

* Cas Consumer `MedTimeWriter.xml`: generates i2b2 Timex3 output format

* Aggregate TAE `MedTimeAggregateTAE.xml`
	
* Collection Processing Engine `MedTimeCPE.xml`

### MedTimer UIMA resources

* `resources/medtimeresources/i2b2/normalization` - normalized forms of time expression

* `resources/medtimeresources/i2b2/repattern` - regular expressions of time information

* `resources/medtimeresources/i2b2/rules` - rules to extract date, time, duration, and frequency

* `resources/medtimeresources/used\_resources.txt` - all paths used in resources

The detailed explanation of resource usage can be found in HeidelTime Wiki (https://github.com/HeidelTime/heideltime)
